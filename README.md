The Balloon Learning Environment (BLE) is a simulator for stratospheric
balloons. It is designed as a benchmark environment for deep reinforcement
learning algorithms, and is a followup to the Nature paper
["Autonomous navigation of stratospheric balloons using reinforcement learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2939-8).

## Our contributions

Highlights of files we contributed to that were mentioned in the report.

* Main MPC Agent: balloon_learning_environment/agents/mpc_agent.py
  - other experimental MPC agents are in the same directory
* Jax Version of Wind Field: balloon_learning_environment/env/generative_wind_field.py
* Jax Version of Atmosphere: balloon_learning_environment/env/balloon/standard_atmosphere.py
* Jax Version of Balloon: balloon_learning_environment/env/balloon/jax_balloon.py

## Installation

This is an easier installation than the g2-installation, but has only been tested on MacOS. If does not work see g2 installation.

```
git clone --branch python3.9 git@github.com:sdean-group/atmosnav.git # need atmosnav to be a 'sibling' of ble folder
cd balloon-learning-environment/ # this repository already cloned
conda create --name ble python=3.9
conda activate ble
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install balloon_learning_environment
pip install --no-deps -e ../atmosnav
```

## Evaluate Agents

Can also add --renderer=matplotlib to show live animation

Can change suite to new_eval to use seeds we ran in our report.

```
JAX_ENABLE_X64=True python -m balloon_learning_environment.eval.eval   --agent=mpc --suite=micro_eval --output_dir=/tmp/ble/eval --feature_constructor=mpc

JAX_ENABLE_X64=True python -m balloon_learning_environment.eval.eval   --agent=mpc4 --suite=micro_eval --output_dir=/tmp/ble/eval --feature_constructor=mpc2

JAX_ENABLE_X64=True python -m balloon_learning_environment.eval.eval   --agent=station_seeker --suite=micro_eval --output_dir=/tmp/ble/eval --feature_constructor=perciatelli

JAX_ENABLE_X64=True python -m balloon_learning_environment.eval.eval   --agent=perciatelli44 --suite=micro_eval --output_dir=/tmp/ble/eval --feature_constructor=perciatelli
```

## g2 Installation

These are different due to G2, but should also work (just unnecessary steps) on personal machines

```
git clone --branch python3.9 git@github.com:sdean-group/atmosnav.git
git clone git@github.com:sdean-group/balloon-learning-environment.git
cd balloon-learning-environment/
conda create --name ble python=3.9
conda activate ble
conda install jupyter
pip install -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html jaxlib==0.3.0
pip install -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html jax==0.3.0
pip install setuptools==65.5.0
pip install pip==23.2
pip install wheel==0.38.0
curl -O https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4b/48/920cea66177b865663fde5a9390a59de0ef3b642ad98106ac1d8717d7005/gym-0.21.0.tar.gz 
pip install gym-0.21.0.tar.gz
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-deps -e ../atmosnav
```


Make sure to use the updated readme that has jax==0.3.0, jaxlib==0.3.0, gym==0.21.0 commented out. PyPi no longer has these versions of JAX and for some reason pip attempts to install a newer version of gym, so these instructions install the right version in the folder.

## Setting up g2 jupyter notebook
Once `ble` conda environment is fully configured (see above), proceed with these steps: 

First, add the following line to the end of `./bashrc`\
`export PATH=/share/apps/anaconda3/2021.05/bin:$PATH`

Then, on local machine, type: (can also be -01, -02, or -05)\
`ssh netid@g2-login-05.coecis.cornell.edu -L PORT:NODE:PORT`\
where PORT is a random integer between 8000 and 10000 and NODE is selected from {dean-cpu-01 or dean-compute-01}

Then, on g2 login node, type the following and replace NODE with the NODE you selected above:\
```
conda activate ble # on login server
srun -p default_partition --pty --mem=2000 --nodelist=NODE /bin/bash
```

On g2 node after you login (which directly follows the step above), type the line below and replace "use_your_netid" with your NetID.\
```
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/use_your_netid jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=PORT
```

Finaly, find a line similar to the string below on your g2 terminal print-out:\
`http://127.0.0.1:PORT/?token=LONG_ALPHANUMERIC_STRING_FROM_JUPYTER-NOTEBOOK_OUTPUT`

Copy `127.0.0.1:PORT` with `PORT` replaced and paste it on your local browser. Use the string after `token` as your "login password".


## Getting Started

Note: The BLE requires python >= 3.7

The BLE can easily be installed with pip:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install balloon_learning_environment
```

To install with the `acme` package:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install balloon_learning_environment[acme]
```

Once the package has been installed, you can test it runs correctly by
evaluating one of the benchmark agents:

```
python -m balloon_learning_environment.eval.eval \
  --agent=station_seeker \
  --renderer=matplotlib \
  --suite=micro_eval \
  --output_dir=/tmp/ble/eval
```

To install from GitHub directly, run the following commands from the root
directory where you cloned the repository:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install .[acme]
```


## Ensure the BLE is Using Your GPU/TPU

The BLE contains a VAE for generating winds, which you will probably want
to run on your accelerator. See the jax documentation for installing with
[GPU](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda) or
[TPU](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-google-cloud-tpu).

As a sanity check, you can open interactive python and run:

```
from balloon_learning_environment.env import balloon_env
env = balloon_env.BalloonEnv()
```

If you are not running with GPU/TPU, you should see a log like:

```
WARNING:absl:No GPU/TPU found, falling back to CPU. (Set TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0 and rerun for more info.)
```

If you don't see this log, you should be good to go!
